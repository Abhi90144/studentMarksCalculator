 Student Marks Calculator
=> Introduction

The Student Marks Calculator is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It helps calculate a student’s TGPA, percentage, and grade based on subject marks and credits.

This project was implemented using Git Bash and GitHub to demonstrate practical knowledge of version control, branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

=> Project Features

Subject-wise marks input

Credit-based TGPA calculation

Automatic percentage calculation

Grade generation based on performance

Simple and user-friendly interface

=> Tech Stack

HTML – Structure of the web application

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Calculation logic

Git Bash – Version control tool

GitHub – Remote repository hosting

=> Git Commands Used

The following Git commands were used during the development of this project:

git init
git status
git add
git commit
git branch
git checkout
git merge
git stash
git rebase
git push

=> Branches Used

main / master – Stable production branch

feature-calculation – TGPA and percentage logic

feature-ui – User interface improvements

bugfix-grade – Fixes related to grade calculation

experiment-validation – Testing and validation logic

=> Branching and Merging Strategy

Each feature and bug fix was developed in a separate branch to ensure safe development.
After testing, changes were merged into the main branch using Git Bash.

This approach helped in:

Isolating features

Preventing code conflicts

Maintaining clean project history

=> Merge Conflict Resolution

A merge conflict occurred when multiple branches modified the same lines in:

README.md

script.js / style.css

The conflict was resolved by:

Manually editing the conflicted file

Removing conflict markers

Keeping the correct logic and styling

Committing the resolved version

This demonstrated understanding of real-world merge conflict handling.
